          <p>
            While cloud offers new opportunities to transform operations,
            security risks still remain the greatest barrier to its adoption.
            According to an (ISC)2 report, almost 93% organizations are
            moderately or extremely concerned about cloud security. The
            companies already using cloud solutions increased their cloud
            security budgets by 98% in 2022, as per the Cloud Data Security
            Survey Report.

            necessity of making your cloud journey secure, hereâ€™s what we

              <div>
                <img src={item.image} alt={item.title} />
              </div>
              <h3>{item.title}</h3>
              <p>{item.text}</p>
            </LitleFlex>
          ))}
        </Grid>
